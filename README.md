# osinttools
A collection of random OSINT files.

## OSINT Maps XMind MindMaps
Version 1 of this file is an older resource for people looking to document OSINT-related investigations. Originally created by myself (Micah Hoffman) as a resource for my [SANS SEC487 OSINT class](https://www.sans.org/sec487), it was GREATLY augmented by [Steve Hall](https://twitter.com/shall_1) and is here for your use and for you to add content to it for others to use.

Version 2 of this file strips out the scoping questions and process nodes and focuses on the data collection for human, business, and IP/domain targets.

It requires the free [XMind MindMapping software](https://www.xmind.net/) and works on Linux, Windows, and macOS platforms.
